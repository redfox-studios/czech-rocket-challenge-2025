# Czech Rocket Challenge 2025 – RedFox Studios

> [!NOTE]
> We registered for the Czech Rocket Challenge 2025 and successfully designed a rocket using the OpenRocket software. Initial documentation, reports and planning were completed. However, due to time constraints caused by our mandatory [final-year school project](https://github.com/redfox-studios/ShardDash), we were unable to continue hardware and software development.
>  
> This project was a passion of ours, but we’ve made the decision to discontinue it.
